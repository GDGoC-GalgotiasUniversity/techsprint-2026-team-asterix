### Key Capabilities
- **🚨 Instant SOS**: Trigger emergency alerts with a single tap or voice command.
- **📍 Real-time Tracking**: Live location sharing with trusted contacts.
- **🎙️ Audio & Video Evidence**: Automatically records and streams audio/video to the server when SOS is activated.
- **⚡ Quick Actions**: Shake-to-alert and voice-activated emergency modes.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites
1.  **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
2.  **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17** or higher
3.  **Maven** (for Backend)
4.  **Expo Go** app on your physical device (Android/iOS)

### 1️⃣ Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

The backend handles API requests, user data, and media uploads.

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd Backend

# Build the project (skip tests for faster build)
mvn clean install -DskipTests

# Run the application
mvn spring-boot:run
```
*The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`*

### 2️⃣ Frontend Setup (Expo)

The frontend is the mobile interface for the user.

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd Frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the Expo development server
npx expo start
```

**To run on your device:**
1.  Open the **Expo Go** app on your phone.
2.  Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal.
3.  Ensure your phone and computer are on the **same Wi-Fi network**.
